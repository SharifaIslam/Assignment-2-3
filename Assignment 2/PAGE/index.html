        <p>Economists have suggested that the government open a hotline service through which ultra-poor people facing
            food
            crisis during "lockdown" can communicate their sufferings and the government can take prompt steps to get
            food
            to them.The upcoming budget should be aimed at saving people's lives, the economists proposed during a
            pre-budget virtual meeting with Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal yesterday.

            Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman,
            former Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Atiur Rahman and former finance minister M Syeduzzaman were among 30
            economists who took part in the meeting.

            Discussants at the meeting informed The Daily Star that the economists suggested that the government go for
            more allocation for health sector, specially in the tertiary and mid-level in the upcoming budget.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They proposed that the government take steps like sending money digitally to the ultra-poor who would suffer
            financially during the "lockdown" imposed by the government to curb the spread of coronavirus.</p>

        <p>One of the most important socio-religious festival celebrated by the Chakma community in the Chattogram hill
            tracts, Bizu begins at the stroke of midnight on 11 April, by collecting flowers from the neighbourhood.
            Some flowers are collected from neighbours without taking their permission, as it is valued as an
            established festival ritual that signifies strong positive outcome of social connection.</p>

        <p> 12 April is called 'Ful-Bizu,' the first day of Bizu celebration that includes offering flowers to Lord
            Buddha and releasing floating flowers in lakes and rivers to bid goodbye to misfortune, to pay respects to
            the goddess of water and seek divine blessings. Every corner, doors, especially the main entrance of every
            house, is decorated with collected colourful flowers.
            <br>

            Discussants at the meeting informed The Daily Star that the economists suggested that the government go for
            more allocation for health sector, specially in the tertiary and mid-level in the upcoming budget.
